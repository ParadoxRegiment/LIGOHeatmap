This is a proof of concept program to create and display a heatmap of numerous STAMP-PEM environmental noise channels used by LIGO.
To run the program you must have both autolines_annotated_only.txt and coh_matrix.npz downloaded and in the same directory as Chan_Heatmap.py.
Finally, load_lines_from_linesfile and match_bins are not my code, they were copied from the LIGO FScan gitlab with permission from one of the researchers.
